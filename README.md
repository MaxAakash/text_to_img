üìå HOW TO RUN
-------------

1. Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed (Colab works fine too).
2. Install required libraries:

   pip install diffusers transformers accelerate gradio

3. Run the script:

   python stable_diffusion_ui.py

4. A web interface will open in your browser.
   Enter your prompt, choose style, resolution, steps ‚Äî and click "Generate".

üíª TECHNOLOGIES USED
---------------------

- ü§ñ Diffusers (by HuggingFace): Core library for Stable Diffusion pipelines.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Transformers: Required for handling prompt tokenization.
- üöÄ Accelerate: Helps with device (CPU/GPU) compatibility.
- üé® Gradio: Easy and beautiful web interface for image generation apps.
- üîç torch (PyTorch): Underlying deep learning framework.

üß† WHY THESE TOOLS?
--------------------

- HuggingFace's `diffusers` is the most flexible and lightweight way to run Stable Diffusion.
- `Gradio` makes it easy to create a friendly, shareable UI ‚Äî no frontend code needed.
- `torch` and `accelerate` let the model automatically choose CUDA if available, otherwise fallback to CPU.
- Designed to run **without login, keys, or APIs** ‚Äî lightweight and offline-ready.

‚ö†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------------

- If the **images are taking too long to generate**, it's likely you're running on CPU.
- The model runs much faster with **CUDA (GPU)**. If it's unavailable, generation time will be higher.
- To fix this:
   ‚úÖ Enable **GPU** in Colab (`Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU`)
  
   ‚úÖ Try running the code in Google Colab (with GPU enabled in settings).

   ‚úÖ Or, run it on your **own machine** if you have a dedicated GPU (NVIDIA recommended).

- If you're using Colab and GPU quota is over, wait a few hours or try CPU mode (but slower).

üìÇ OUTPUT
---------

- The app generates **2 images per prompt** and displays them in the interface.
- Future versions can save images locally or allow downloading.
